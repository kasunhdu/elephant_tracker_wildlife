Problem Statement- As a result of forest clearing, human-elephant conflicts have also increased and led to the destruction of property and death of both humans and elephants. The problem is compounded by the elephant's preference for crops such as sugar cane, bananas and other fruits frequently grown in the region. In 2023, about 476 wild elephants and 169 human were lost as a result of human-elephant conflict.
